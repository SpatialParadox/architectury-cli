# Architectury CLI
A command-line tool that allows [Architectury templates](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates) to be downloaded
and extracted into project folders.

This is a very simple tool, and currently only supports the following features:
- Creating project directories from a given template
- Listing available templates along with their supported Minecraft version(s)
